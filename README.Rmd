knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "README-"
)
```

The R package `instevalR` and the app [Shiny InstevalR](https://hplieninger.shinyapps.io/ShinyInstevalR/) are useful for people doing course evaluations (at universities, e.g., U Mannheim) with the software [InstEvaL](https://insteval.uni-mannheim.de). The package has functions to combine the results of several course evaluations (e.g., different courses/cohorts of a single instructor) and to plot those results:

```{r example-plot, eval=T, echo=F, fig.align='center', out.width='67%', dpi = 150, cache = TRUE}
library("instevalR")
set.seed(123456)
dat1 <- sim_eval(N_files = 3, N_id = 100)
plot_eval(dat1)
```

In order to use this package, you need three things:

1.  The CSV-files with the raw data of your course evaluations, which you can download from InstEvaL (log in to [InstEvaL](https://insteval.uni-mannheim.de) -> Results -> Raw data). Please save all your CSV-files in a single directory (they probably have names ending with 'evaluationen.csv').
2.  R, which you can download from https://www.r-project.org
3.  The package `instevalR`

The easiest way to install the package `instevalR` is to install it directly from GitHub:

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hplieninger/instevalR")
```

After you have your CSV-files, R, and the package, you can get started:

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
library("instevalR")                             # load in every new R session
tmp1 <- read_eval()                              # read raw data
dat1 <- join_eval(tmp1)                          # combine into single data frame
plot_eval(dat1)                                  # plot
?plot_eval                                       # help; check out Examples
```

If you're unfamiliar with R, you may find the shiny app useful which you can run locally using `shiny_eval()` or simply go to https://hplieninger.shinyapps.io/ShinyInstevalR/. Furthermore, you can simulate data using `sim_eval()`, and you can create a nice summary table using `datatable_eval()`.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
library("instevalR")                             # load in every new R session
shiny_eval()                                     # interactive shiny app

dat1 <- sim_eval()                               # simulate data   
plot_eval(dat1)                                  # plot
datatable_eval(dat1)
```

Happy teaching. You are welcome to send any bug reports, feature requests, or comments via GitHub Issues or via email.
